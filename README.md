# 🧠 ELE489 Homework 2 – Decision Tree Classifier

This project is part of the ELE489 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning course. It focuses on implementing and evaluating a decision tree classifier using the Banknote Authentication Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📁 Files Included
- `decision_tree.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code, outputs, visualizations, and explanations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication)
- Features:
  - Variance
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
  - Entropy
- Target: Class (0 = Fake, 1 = Authentic)

## 🔧 Tasks Completed
- Loaded and visualized the dataset.
- Manually calculated Gini Index (Q1).
- Trained a decision tree classifier using scikit-learn.
- Evaluated the model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualized the decision tree structure and feature importances.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Open `decision_tree.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in order to see results and visualizations.
